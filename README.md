# Overview of the Business Optimization Project
This project aims to demonstrate how to solve a business optimization problem using Linear Programming (LP) and Python libraries such as PuLP. The goal is to help a manufacturing company determine the optimal number of two products (Product A and Product B) to produce in order to maximize profits, given certain constraints on machine usage.

Problem Statement:
A manufacturing company produces two products, Product A and Product B, using two machines. The company wants to determine the optimal number of each product to produce in order to maximize profits, considering the following:

Profit per Unit:
Product A generates a profit of $40 per unit.
Product B generates a profit of $30 per unit.
Machine Usage:
Machine 1 can be used for a total of 120 hours.
Machine 2 can be used for a total of 80 hours.
Production Requirements:
Product A requires 2 hours of Machine 1 and 1 hour of Machine 2 per unit.
Product B requires 1 hour of Machine 1 and 1 hour of Machine 2 per unit.
The objective is to find the number of units of Product A and Product B to produce such that the total profit is maximized while respecting the machine usage constraints
